# 1.What the project does

This memory game was supposed to test your ability to keep track of the outher lines of the object you just saw.
You will see an object for 3 seconds before it disappears and it's your turn to press mouse down to
draw the lines of the object as you remember it. In Order to pass to next level the program will read wether
you keep your mouse within a close enough range or not (true or false). If not, level starts over.
If webpage is refreshed, game starts over from beginning. I'm thinking 3 levels.


# 2.Why the project is useful

It was supposed to explore how I could challenge the users memory with a 'move your mouse'-task. 
Due to realization of the browsers limits seen to allow robotjs get access to it when wanting to
run the game I decided to drop this idea and move on with the iteration theEndOfTheRoad instead.

# 3.How users can get started with the projectHow to use your code

You cant.

# 4.Who maintains and contributes to the project

No maintaining will be done.
