This memory game is supposed to test your abillity to keep track of the outher lines of the object you just saw.
You will see an object for 3 seconds before it disappears and it's your turn to press mouse down to
draw the lines of the object as you remember it. In Order to pass to next level the program will read wether
you keep your mouse within a cose enough range or not (true or false). If not, level starts over.
If webpage is refreshed, game starts over from beginning. I'm thinking 3 levels.
