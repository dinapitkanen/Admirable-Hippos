#auto_login

##description:
	Small script that automatically logs into all of the accounts in loginInfo.txt.
	Made in Windows, so modules might have to be reinstalled for mac users.

##note:
	OS-level resolution scaling and robotjs don't work hand-in-hand.
	For Windows users, remove resolution scaling in the display settings.
