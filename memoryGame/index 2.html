<!-- This memory game is supposed to test your ability to keep track of the range of the object you just saw. You will see an object for 3 seconds before it disappears and it's your turn to press mouse down to draw the lines of the object as you remember it. In Order to pass to next level the program will read wether you keep your mouse within a certain range or not (true or false). If not, level starts over. If webpage is refreshed, game starts over from beginning. I'm thinking 3 levels.-->
