# auto_login

## description:
	Small script that automatically logs into all of the accounts in loginInfo.txt.

## note:

	General:
	* Run Runelite once before using the program to ensure the client's updated and has the required permissions. 

	For Windows: 
	* Runelite's .exe comes pre-packed and is ready to go.
	* OS-level resolution scaling and robotjs don't work hand-in-hand. For Windows users, remove resolution scaling in the display settings.
	For MacOS: 
	* Runelite has to be installed before running. The .dmg is included. 
	* Made in Windows, so modules will have to be reinstalled for mac users.
