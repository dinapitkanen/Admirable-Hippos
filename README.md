## What the project does Describe your project

Our project is to explore the API Robotjs and try examples to learn different ways to make it useful in prototyping.

## 2.Why the project is useful

To us the project is useful in order to expand our possibilities and skills for prototyping work. Through this API we give ourselves the chance to learn some tools there is to implement programming that contributes with methods like reading mouse position, reading color codes, screen capturing, move mouse and change attributes of specific keys to move mouse(see syntax for Robotjs). 

## 3.How users can get started with the project
1. install node
2. open the terminal in the example folder and write the command 'npm install' and press enter
3. to run the example, write in the terminal 'node "theNameOfTheJavaScriptFile.js"'

When reading our code please have in mind that they are coded in both Mac and PC. We have tried to make them work as good as possible but there are some differences that we cannot debug by default. For example what color is exposed on every screen. These kind of bugs could need modifications by yourself if you are to work with our code. And of course, many bugs is simply a result by our beginner knowledge.
